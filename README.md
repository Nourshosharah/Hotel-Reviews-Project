do some data visualizations and perform useful Analysis like top hotels in a city or some other insights like popularity over time.

### Data Set
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. 
This dataset contains 515,000 rows and scoring of 1493 luxury hotels across Europe. The geographical location of hotels are also provided. 
Following are the features included in data set: Hotel Name, Hotel Address, Hotel score, Review Date, Reviewer Nationality, Positive review, Negative review, reviewer score, tags, days since review.

it's a large group of guest reviews in Western Europe hotel, more than 500,000 reviews for 1493 luxury hotels, as for the guests we have more than 200 nationalities, and about 50% of the reviews or data are for hotels in the United Kingdom, and for each review in the data we have a positive review and negative review.
We will explore the data, clean it up, work on the analysis, and then choose the appropriate prediction model.

## Deployment

As part of the project, I have performed using StreamLit. we have learnt on the steps to take when performing an end-to-end project. This includes re-factoring of codes into functions so to easier compliation when compilin. In order to deploy a model, you will need to understand what you want to achieve and re-look at the code on how you could recode to achieve that.
