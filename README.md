Do some data visualizations and perform useful Analysis like top hotels in a city or some other insights like popularity over time.

, as for the guests we have more than 200 nationalities, and about 50% of the reviews or data are for hotels in the United Kingdom,

and for each review in the data we have a positive review and negative review.

We will explore the data, clean it up, work on the analysis, and then choose the appropriate prediction model.



### Abstract
If you want to visit Spain, Austria, Italy, France, the Netherlands or the United Kingdom, whether in a leisure or business stay, and if you are alone or with friends, we will help you discover the best through more than 500 K reviews of hotels in Europe through the Booking.com.
## Objectives:
- Analyze the dataset with a focus on the reviewers’ nationality.

- [AND MUCH MORE](https://github.com/Nourshosharah/Hotel-Reviews-Project/blob/main/Business%20Questions%20And%20Solutions/Business_Solutions_Hotel_Reviews.ipynb).

- Develop a recommendation system which gives a list of recommended hotels based on user’s hotel selection
- Develop a recommendation system to show you best and worst reviews of hotel you selected


## Skills & Analysis:


- Feature Engineering
- Business Question
- EDA
- Data Cleaning 
- Feature Engineering
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) encoding
- Sentiment analysis
- Model Building and evaluation:
-   1. we choose to build model to predict satisficatipn (satisfied of custumer or not) based on revierwer score [first approach](https://github.com/Nourshosharah/Hotel-Reviews-Project/blob/main/Modeling/modeling1-hotel-reviews.ipynb)
    2. we choose another approch to build sentiment analysis model based on (positive and negative reviews) [second approach](https://github.com/Nourshosharah/Hotel-Reviews-Project/blob/main/Modeling/modeling-with-other-approach.ipynb)
- Cosine Similarity
- Content Recommendation system
- Interactive StreamLit App

## Deployment

As part of the project, I have performed using StreamLit. we have learnt on the steps to take when performing an end-to-end project. This includes re-factoring of codes into functions so to easier compliation when compilin. In order to deploy a model, you will need to understand what you want to achieve and re-look at the code on how you could recode to achieve that.

You may access the deployed site [here](https://share.streamlit.io/nourshosharah/hotel-reviews-project/main/app.py).
